## Question 1

A pharmaceutical company is interested in testing a potential blood pressure lowering medication. Their first examination considers only subjects that received the medication at baseline then two weeks later. The data are as follows (SBP in mmHg)

Subject	Baseline	Week 2
1	140	        132
2	138	        135
3	150	        151
4	148	        146
5	135	        130

Consider testing the hypothesis that there was a mean reduction in blood pressure? Give the P-value for the associated two sided T test.

(Hint, consider that the observations are paired.)
